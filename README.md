# Basic-Network-Monitoring-Tool
This tool will help you monitor devices on your network, see active IPs, scan ports, and even log results.

Project Plan
Weâ€™ll split it into steps so you can learn as you go:
Step	Task
1	Set up your Python environment
2	Build an IP scanner (who is on the network?)
3	Add port scanning (which ports are open?)
4	Add logging to a text file
5	Optional: Create simple UI or CLI menu
6	Upload to GitHub with README and screenshots
